# steelman-suite hook: pre-push-attack-on-high-blast.sh
#
# PreToolUse hook for Bash with `git push`. Runs `steelman:attack-fix`
# (5-10 min, 3-reviewer jury) ONLY when the diff being pushed touches a path
# the operator has declared high-blast-radius.
#
# Routine pushes pay <1s overhead (path check + early exit).
#
# INSTALL: copy snippet into ~/.claude/settings.json (see ../docs/HOOKS.md).
#
# CONFIG:
#   STEELMAN_HIGH_BLAST_PATHS  — space-separated path patterns
#                                 (e.g. "migrations/ src/main.py")
#   STEELMAN_DISABLED          — any value silences the hook
#
# DECISION SEMANTICS:
#   - exit 0: allow push (default; pair found no blocker OR no high-blast files)
#   - exit 2: BLOCK push (loud message in stderr; operator must re-invoke
#               or pass --no-verify to override)

# Filter: only fire on `git push` invocations.
#
# Claude Code's PreToolUse hook fires on every Bash tool call when matcher is
# "Bash" in settings.json. To restrict to `git push`, read the tool input from
# stdin (JSON) and short-circuit silently if the command is not a push.
#
# 2026-05-19 hotfix: removes the global `exit 0` bypass added earlier while
# diagnosing the matcher issue. Operator-binding decision: option (a) — patch
# at hook script (filtering inside) instead of changing matcher schema in
# settings.json (which Claude Code doesn't accept for command-pattern filters
# on Bash). See task #4 in session ee7b0652.
